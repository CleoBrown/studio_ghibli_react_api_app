# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Weekend Homework: React Application with Requests

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a multi-component web application, with React
- Be able to make API requests to load JSON data into your application

## Brief

Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

Suggested APIs:

1. Studio Ghibli: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/
2. Reddit: (Append `.json` to any Reddit URL - for example https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript.json)
3. Guardian search: https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=brexit&format=json&api-key=test


These APIs all allow browser requests without authentication or keys. (In the case of the Guardian, `api-key=test` should be sufficient.)

There is a more extensive list of public APIs [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) that have varying degrees of accessibility. If you choose to use a different API, make sure you are able to load the data into your application without issue, so that you can spend the time focussing on building your application. We suggest you do not use an API that requires authentication (OAuth), though using an API which requires a key is fine, as long as you are able to get a key quickly and easily.

### MVP

- The application should display data from an API request.
- The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
- Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.
